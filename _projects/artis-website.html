	<!-- Poject Goal -->
	<strong class="strong-small">
		Goal for the project
	</strong>
	<p class="paragraph light">
		Client contacted me with a desire to get most of the clients via website. Goal is to present his company as modern, experienced, and high quality
		deliverables company.
	</p><br>

	<!-- Content strategy -->
	<strong class="strong-small">
		Content strategy
	</strong>
	<p class="paragraph light">
		We need content that will explain company philosophy, vision, and what Artis can do for page visitor. After I got the content I’ll start with creating
		wireframes. (Also, I created an information architecture, but unfortunately, I didn’t capture any of it for this particular project.)
	</p> <br>

	<!-- Wireframes -->
	<strong class="strong-small">
		Wireframes
	</strong>
	<p class="paragraph light">
		I created couple versions of wireframes where I would put the needed content.
	</p><br>

	<img class="w-md-50 d-block m-auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/artis/wireframes.jpg" alt="{{page.name}} | {{page.description}} | {{page.client_location}}" title="{{page.name}} | {{page.description}} | Wireframes">

	<p class="paragraph light">
		Since company’s name isn’t so self-explanatory, landing section will have clear title of couple words that will company do, description bellow title that will
		explain a little more about company, image, and of course, call to action buttons, one “GET YOUR PROJECT DONE” that will send visitor to the contact page,
		and “WHY ARTIS” that will send a visitor to “WHY ARTS” page. <br><br>

		The last wireframe is the most similar to the final website.<br><br>

		As visitor scroll through the home page, it will come across about section, philosophy section, services section, and CTA or contact section. As you can see,
		the actual order of section is different than on wireframe. I thought about it, and I got the conclusion that is better to present to the visitor the company’s
		vision before we show them all the services they can get.<br><br>

		As we can see, creating a website is never a straight and complete process, we always can think of something that will potentially improve the experience.<br>
	</p><br>

	<!-- Design -->
	<strong class="strong-small">
		Design
	</strong>
	<p class="paragraph light">
		Next step in the process is actual design. In this step, we first talked about the style of the website. We talked about the colors and style. Since we want Artis
		to have artistic, modern kind of vibe, that is the direction we went through.
	</p><br>

	<!-- Color Scheme -->

	<p class="paragraph light">
		Starting with the landing section, we needed some simple, artistic, modern looking, with a metal image. Because Artis is not an ordinary company, because
		Artis think outside the box, we want an image to be like that. Slightly going out of the box over neighbor section.

	<p class="paragraph light">
		We want a client to be able to contact the company directly from the header, so we have “mail” icon that will open a mail client on click with predefined e-
		mail. We also want to be easily called from mobile phones, so in the mobile menu, we have “make a call” button.
